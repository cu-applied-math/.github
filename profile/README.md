## Outreach
- Between 2015 and 2022 many applied math students (and others) helped with a data science summer camp for high schoolers in the Boulder/Denver area. There are repositories related to this work, e.g., [disease-modeling-camp](https://github.com/cu-applied-math/disease-modeling-camp) and [stem-camp-notebooks](https://github.com/cu-applied-math/stem-camp-notebooks)
